# Data
This repository should contain the directories for emoji corporates consisting of published emojis. Due to the license issue, you should place the dataset by yourself. Emoji dataset can be obtained from [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/subinium/emojiimage-dataset). In addition, [EmoTag1200 file](https://github.com/abushoeb/EmoTag/blob/master/data/EmoTag1200-scores.csv) should be placed in this directory which provides the corresponding emotion scores for each emoji. The data directory is expected to consist as follows.
